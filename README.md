# Four-In-A-Row
A console version of "Four In A Row" made as a practice project.

I made this project after having completed the Udemy course "C# Developers: Learn the Art of Writing Clean Code" and tried to follow the principles I had just learned.

What I Learned:
- Working with two-dimensional arrays in practice.
